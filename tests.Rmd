#### Hard Test

For the final test, I created a R package called `Calculator`. It contains five functions, `add()`, `substract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()` and `modulo()` , with documentation and tests. Then, using `devtools::check()`, I checked for any errors or warning, and uploaded the source file to <https://win-builder.r-project.org/>. It passed without errors/warnings/note.

The result of [\<https://win-builder.r-project.org/\>](https://win-builder.r-project.org/){.uri} is included in the github repository(`00check.log`).
